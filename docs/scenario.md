# McGill Water Scenario

## Call Plan

* Call RedWind and present scenario
	* <s>Present our flooding scenario - this is what happens and what we did in real case..</s>
	* <s>Present functions </s>
	* Ask them for their ideas how they would use it to solve the scenario (without us presenting the solution)
	* Present our concepted / prototyped solution (and we can present our ideas how they could run the scenario there to test)
	* Wrap up the call 
	* Leave the homework for them to test the scenario (to really test it there!)
* Call back in a week of two after they have tried it out...

## Scenario
In this short scenario we are going to present a scenario based loosely on real events that occured at McGill. We want to use this scenario to help us think together about the features of our system and how they could be used in an emergency. In particular our data filtering system and how it can be used collaboratively.

Last month, a 48-inch water main broke at the top of the hill that descends into downtown Montreal, right through the main McGill campus. There was massive flooding through all of the streets and into many of the buildings on surrounding campus, with black ice underneath, making it practically impassable in many spots. The campus was almost completely surrounded by water making it challenging to find a way off campus.

Jeff left just after the main break, but before any official news had been sent. He could not get off campus easily since the water was flowing too deep and fast through the streets, and had no way of figuring out how far the situation spread without slogging through knee-deep water. There were many students and others standing around with cameras taking pictures and video all around campus (later dozens of videos were posted online) and posting on social media.

For those in the buildings trying to plan their way home, being able to see these images, videos and tweets might have been helpful. But without some way of sorting and filtering it might also simply have been overwhelming. 

We imagine that our rtER would have helped us solve this problem. By allowing information -- video, image or text -- to be visualised in geographic context (on the rtER map) users could quickly understand what was occuring where. Moreover, filtering using the map would have provided a way for those looking for a way of campus to eliminate all superflous information and see only the information coming from one area on their map. This would mean you could quickly confirm or deny if a route was safe. 

Also since we are trying to build our system with collaboration in mind, repetious search would be avoided and time could be saved. For example in this case most people posting pictures and videos were "ambulance chaser". Showing the drama and devastation, not the less interesting safe area. This means that the "useful" information is being burried by the "shock value" videos. Once a person had found a safe passage using our system, maybe that one tweet suggesting a safe route, maybe a picture or a video showing an unflooded area, they could promote that information to higher priority for others to see. As a results the next person wouldn't need to repeat that search. They might instead simply add a confirmation after using the route, or perhaps provide an alternative. In this way we hope our system may make a more efficient use of human resources.

(Possible blurb about interactive video, e.g. direct field users to look away from drama for safe route. But I think it's too specific and should be left out for this scenario)

Of course in this context the data would have been most useful for the McGill comunity, and we are not a group trained responders. However we think it provides a simple illustration of how a group of people in an emergency could be using our system to share and manage information to help acheive a common goal: finding safe routes off campus. We could imagine replacing the McGill members with emergency responders are looking for safe staging areas, clear routes to move injured people in and out, maybe looking for vantage point access the broken water main, etc. Collaborating using information both from the responders and from outside source to answer a common question or understand a situation better.
