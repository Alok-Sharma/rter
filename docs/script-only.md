The rtER web client allows emergency responders to collaboratively filter and organize real-time information, including live video, Twitter feeds, and other social media. 

With rtER instantly promoting information to your collaborators is as simple as grabbing a tile and dragging it to the top.
Dragging key information up instantly promotes it for all your collaborators. 

Importantly, rtER makes live, interactive video from mobile users available to emergency response personnel. 

Because emergency response personnel in Red Wing are already equipped with iPhones, an iOS version of mobile app is now available.

The web client also allows emergency personnel to direct the viewpoint from mobile users in the field, helping obtain more valuable information to inform their decision-making.

We've also responded to the needs of public safety officers in Quebec City who performed field testing with our system. We've met their requirement for higher frame rate with an HTML5 video streaming pipeline from the phone to the browser.

Individuals who need to monitor information do so as part of a team. However, emergency responders, for example, in the city of Red Wing often perform joint operations where local and state emergency response groups collaborate with each other without losing control of their workspaces.

We've tackled  this problem with "tags" that can be added directly by users or by the system, automatically. In rtER each tag is a workspace in which content is independently organized and ranked.

Here local Red Wing responders have their own workspace under the rewing-eoc tag where they can manage relevant to the city  of Red Wing. If they notic  something relevant to emergency response personnel at the state level, they can simply tag it to send it to the state workspace under the state-eoc tag

The associated contents then show up right away on the screens of state responders in their own independant workspace
 
Transferring content between workspaces is as easy as adding the appropriate tags.  Furthermore, auto-tagging could include labels such as the trustworthiness of the source, helping automatically seperate contents submitted by a trained volunteer versus a member of the general public.

Finally, we realized that to be most effective, rtER  must be part of an ecosystem of other tools used by responders. The rtER infrastructure is now built around a RESTful API, just as used by twitter and youtube. This means that rtER can easily access data from such external sources.  Moreover, the collaboratively filtered data from rtER is available for reuse by third-party services.
